# PAGES

**This directory is not required, it is only here as an example for the structure.**

This directory contains your Application Views and Routes. The framework reads all the *.vue files inside this directory and creates the router of your application.

More information about the usage of this directory in the documentation.

How to activate:
1. Disable app.vue.
2. Rename the folder into "pages".
