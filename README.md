## Creating Content

### Storyblok

#### Home page

Since the home page requires some special care because of the fact that we cant have the root page have the slug "/" we need to have the slug as index.

1. Create a new story with the type "Content Page".
2. Name it anything.
3. Put 'slug' as "index" - That way Vrtx.ContentSystem knows its the home page.

4. Add content.
5. Publish.

#### Header Menu

Since menu is special it needs to be of the content type 'Menu' and have the 'slug' "menu" .

1. Create a new story with the type "Menu".
2. Name it anything.
3. Put 'slug' as "menu" - That way Vrtx.ContentSystem knows its the menu.

4. Add a few departments (each department is a menu option).
5. Publish.

#### Footer Menu

Since footer is special it needs to be of the content type 'Menu' and have the 'slug' "footer".

1. Create a new story with the type "Menu".
2. Name it anything.
3. Put 'slug' as "footer" - That way Vrtx.ContentSystem knows its the footer.

## Creating a private fork

Sometimes you might wanna create a private fork (even if the license and github don't allow it). The easiest way to create a private version is to use the template function:

The other option is to manually create a repo and add the repo as an upstream you can pull from. If you want to do that do this:
1. Create an empty private repo.
2. Clone the empty repo locally.
3. Add Vrtx.ContentSystem repo as an upstream with: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/SebbeJohansson/Vrtx.ContentSystem.git`
4. Disable pushing to upstream (since you are not allowed to do that either way): `git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE`
5. Pull main from the upstream: `git pull upstream/main main`
6. Fix any potential merge issues.
